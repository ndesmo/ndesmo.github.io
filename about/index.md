Hello! I am Nick Desmond, a data analyst. This website is an experiment by me to see if I can:

* Set up a blog using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* Write up posts using [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/)
* Participate in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) competitions and document my experiences
* Write posts about current events with a "data" twist
* Write articles about data techniques I have learned
